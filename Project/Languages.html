      <h3>Common Tongue</h3>
      <p>The Common Tongue, or the Old Tongue, is the most widely spoken language in the Wheel of Time world. It is the lingua franca for most of the inhabitants of the Westlands and other regions of the world. It is derived from an ancient language known as the Old Tongue, which is still used in some regions for ceremonial purposes.</p>

      <h3>The Old Tongue</h3>
      <p>The Old Tongue is an ancient language spoken by the people of the Age of Legends. It is often used in specific contexts, such as in the names of places, people, and events from that era. Some phrases and words from the Old Tongue still linger in common speech, particularly in the magical world of Aes Sedai and in prophecies.</p>

      <h3>Seanchan Language</h3>
      <p>The Seanchan people have their own language, which is distinct from the Common Tongue. The language of the Seanchan is used primarily in their homeland and among the Seanchan-speaking people, though it is also seen in some areas controlled by the Seanchan Empire. This language is considered to be ancient, with deep ties to their culture and history.</p>

      <h3>Ogier Language</h3>
      <p>The Ogier, a peaceful and long-lived race of non-human beings, have their own language, known as the Ogier language. The Ogier speak this language amongst themselves, but it is not widely spoken by humans. However, certain Ogier words and phrases have made their way into the Common Tongue, especially in areas where the Ogier are present.</p>

      <h3>Shienaran Dialect</h3>
      <p>In the Borderlands, particularly in Shienar, a distinct dialect of the Common Tongue is spoken. The Shienaran dialect includes unique pronunciations and vocabulary that set it apart from the Common Tongue spoken in other parts of the world. It is notable for its use of formal speech and honorifics.</p>

      <h3>Aiel Language</h3>
      <p>The Aiel people, who live in the desert lands, have their own language, which is also a variant of the Old Tongue. The Aiel language is closely related to the Old Tongue but contains distinct vocabulary and grammar. Their language plays an important part in their culture, and Aiel often speak in riddles and metaphorical phrases.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Other Languages</h3>
      <p>Throughout the world of the Wheel of Time, there are many smaller languages spoken by various peoples, such as the languages of the Tuatha'an (the Tinkers), the Seanchan's various provinces, and the different cultures scattered across the continents. Some of these languages are lost to history or only spoken in very isolated areas.</p>
